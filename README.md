# CovHack 

## The idea : 

As we live in an era of fear and panic growing from the constant presence of the COVID-19 around us, we wanted to bring some lightness to the world.
Everyday, as people receive their newspapers, check the news online... The only titles they see relate to the Coronavirus and how terrible it is. Aren't you tired of getting covid news everywhere ? 
This is why we want to build a filter for news and social media to get rid of any covid related articles according to the user's parameters choice. It would allow everyone to get their daily news without being forced to have the main part of their feed full of COVID.


## What we can do :

* There is a slider that you can use to select the pourcentage of information about the covid that are filtered
* It is possible to click on each article to open, it's a link
* Possibility to filter the news with some predefined options such as subject of article (sports, economy, ...) and by country

## Problems that we encountered :

* Learning the framework Angular is not an easy process
* Finding a way to filter the information accordingly

## What we have learned :

* API's are cool
* Web deb is cool
