## The idea : 

As we live in an era of fear and panic growing from the constant presence of the COVID-19 around us, we wanted to bring some lightness to the world.
Everyday, as people receive their newspapers, check the news online... The only titles they see relate to the Coronavirus and how terrible it is. Aren't you tired of getting covid news everywhere ? 
This is why we want to build a filter for news and social media to get rid of any covid related articles according to the user's parameters choice. It would allow everyone to get their daily news without being forced to have the main part of their feed full of COVID.


## What we can do :

* There is a slider that you can use to select the pourcentage of information about the covid that are filtered
* It is possible to click on each article to open, it's a link
* Possibility to filter the news with some predefined options such as subject of article (sports, economy, ...) and by country

## Problems that we encountered :

* Learning the framework Angular is not an easy process
* Finding a way to filter the information accordingly

## What we have learned :

* API's are cool
* Web deb is cool

## The display:

When you first arrive on the page, you see 3 important panels:

* The side bar where you can go through several settings. The side bar can be hidden by clicking on the 3 little menu bars (<- image)
* All the news articles displayed in the middle according to the settings selected
* A painting to enlighten your day


## Preferences and settings:

Your search choices will be defined by changing the settings of the side bar.

* **The source:** you can choose which source you want your information from 
  * _If **Google** was chosen, as it displays several different newspapers, you can decide to keep some newspapers'info even on **100% blocking mode** by adding them in **exclusions**. If you have a trusted source and want to receive its info on any subject it is the place to put them_

* **The filtering percentage:** you can define the filtering percentage for coronavirus.
  * _**0%** corresponds to no filtering, as if you were opening the news as usual_

  * _**100%** is completely blocking all possible news related to Covid, which lets you scroll through your news feed freely._

* **The category:**   From the list of categories displayed, you can choose the one you want to explore!
